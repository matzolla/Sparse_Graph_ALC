# Sparse Graph agglomerative Likelihood Clustering

[Allassan Tchangmena](), [Lionel Yelibi]()

In this project, we propose a sparse aglomerative clustering algorithm, to cluster nodes from a graph with similar properties (base on their `weights`
and `edges`. The criterion used for clustering is a likelihood function inspired from Giada and Marsili that has been relaxed to suit graph clustering problems
